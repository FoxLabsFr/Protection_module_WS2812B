## üîå Pin Configuration & Wiring

### IN Connector

| Pin | Function | Description                       |
| --- | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| IN  | Data     | Data input signal from controller |
| 5V  | Power    | 5V DC power supply                |
| GND | Ground   | Ground connection                 |

### OUT Connector

| Pin | Function | Description                     |
| --- | -------- | ------------------------------- |
| OUT | Data     | Data output to LEDs' data input |
| 5V  | Power    | 5V power output for LEDs        |
| GND | Ground   | Ground connection for LEDs      |

### Level Shifter Jumper

The module includes a 2-position jumper for enabling/disabling the 3.3V to 5V level shifter:

| Position | Function | Description                                                                                    |
| -------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **EN**   | Enabled  | Activates level shifter ‚Äî use when connecting to 3.3V logic devices (e.g., STM32, ESP32, etc.) |
| **DIS**  | Disabled | Bypasses level shifter ‚Äî use when connecting to 5V logic devices (e.g., Arduino, etc.)         |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

- **Power Supply:** Verify that your power supply can support the total current required by the LEDs. The JST HX connectors are rated up to 3A. If you plan to use more (for example, setting the LEDs to full brightness), use the solder pads instead, with appropriately sized AWG wires.
- **Data Integrity:** To prevent signal degradation, especially in long LED chains, keep data lines as short as possible.
